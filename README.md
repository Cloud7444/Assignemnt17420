# How server-side rendering work

Server rendering plan: 2. Request a html-> 2. Server request data (intranet request is fast)-> 3. Server initial rendering (server performance is good, faster)-> 4. The server returns a page that already has the correct content-> 5. The client requests the js / css file-> 6. Waiting for the js file to be downloaded-> 7. Waiting for the js to load and initialize-> 8. The client renders the rest (the content is small, rendering is fast
For pages with high user experience requirements (first screen) and public pages with more repetitions, consider using server rendering to reduce ajax requests and improve user experience.
